\section*{Problem 1}

% Spiegare cosa mandiamo e come lo generiamo
In this problem the channel $q(n\frac{T}{4})$ is given at $T_c = \frac{T}{4}$. The goal is to estimate at the receiver the timing phase $t_0$ and the equivalent channel impulse response in $T$ with LS method.
The setting of the system is as in Fig.~\ref{fig:channel_T4}. In order to perform LS estimation the first $L + N_{seq} = 15 + 10$ symbols of the sequence $a_k$ are binary symbols out of a QPSK constellation with $\sigma_a^2 = 2$. 
In particular they are $1+j$ and $-1-j$ and map the $+1$ and $-1$ values of a ML sequence of length $L = 15$, partially repeated by $N_{seq}=10$. Then QPSK data follows. 
The conversion between a bit stream and QPSK is carried out by the \texttt{bitmap} function. %% TODO some more on this?? Give a better formulation

%%TODO Does Eq go in dB???? 

% Spiegare che channel_output funziona da polifase
The noisy output $r_n$ of the channel is computed with a polyphase version of the channel impulse response $q(nT_c)$. Each branch is $q^{i}(mT) = q(mT + i)$ with $i \in [0, 3]$ , and since it is not time-varying it is possible to directly compute the convolution of each branch and the $a_k$ sequence. At the output of each convolution white noise $w_n$ is added, with variance $\sigma_w^2 = \frac{\sigma_a^2 E_q}{4 \Gamma} = -19.2411$ dB, where $\sigma_a^2 = 2$, $E_q = 2.3819$ and $\Gamma = 20$ dB is the given SNR at receiver input. Then a parallel to series converter generates the output at time $T_c$.

% !!! Spiegare come stimiamo t0, riportare l'equazione (Formula 7.269, channel_estimator)
The first operation which the receiver does is estimating $t_0$ as optimal timing phase in $T_c$. In particular, given the stream of symbols $r_n$, and the knowledge of the ML sequence $a_l, l\in [0, L-1]$, the receiver computes

\begin{equation}
	m_{opt} = \argmax_m | x_{ra}(mT_c) | = \argmax_{m} | \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l = 0}^{L - 1} x(lT + mT_c)a^* (l) |
\end{equation}
for $ 0 < m < 40$ and finds that
\begin{equation}
	m_{opt} = 10
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	t_{0} = m_{opt}T_c = 10 T_c
\end{equation}

% Spiegare differenza tra m_opt (in T/4, che è t0), init_offs (in T/4) e delay (in T)
% Is it really useful? Michele
Remeber that $t_0 = 10$ in $T_c$ and the corresponding $D_{ch} = (t_0 \% 4)T = 2T$ represent the number of samples after which the receiver receives the first sample of the training sequence multiplied by $h_0$, which is the coefficient of the channel impulse response with the gratest amplitude. In other words, if the receiver and the transmitter use the same time index $k$ and if $x_k$ is the output at time $T$ of the receiver then
\begin{equation}
x_{k} = h_0a_{k-D_{ch}} + i_k, \quad i_k = \sum_{\substack{i = -N_1 \\ i \neq 0}}^{N_2} h_i a_{k-D_{ch}-i}
\end{equation}
where $i_k$ is the inter-symbol interference. Therefore, if $t_0 = 10T_c$ and $D_{ch} = 2T$ there could be at most 2 precursors (i.e. the coefficients of $h_i$ for $i = -N_1, \dots, -1$), and they can be equal to 0 (they don't introduce ISI but just the delay $D_{ch}$) or different from 0 but with an amplitude lower than $h_0$. 

The receiver can now the estimate of the channel impulse response at time $T$. The output of the channel $r_n$ is sampled at $n = t_0 + kT$ to get $x_k = r_{t_0 + kT}$. Then the LS estimate is computed using the symbols of the known ML sequence $a_k$ sent and a suitable section of the output. Note that the training sequence sent of lenght $L + N_{seq} = 25$ has $N_{seq} = 10$ which is enough to avoid the transient of the channel which is $N - 1$, with $N = N_1 + N_2 + 1$ which is the real length of the impulse response.
Note also that the LS method can estimate a causal impulse response, $\tilde{h}_j, j = 0, \dots, N$, while the channel impulse response could have some precursors which are different from 0, and therefore an anticausal component. In order to correctly estimate $h_i, i = -N_1, \dots, N_2$, given a supposed length $\hat{N} = \hat{N}_1 + \hat{N}_2 + 1$, LS considers $a_k, k = 0, \dots, L+\hat{N}-1$ and the output $x_k, k = D_{ch} - N_1, \dots, D_{ch} - N_1 + L + \hat{N} - 1$ and it performs the estimation in the standard way. This is the same as considering a causal impulse response, with $\hat{N}$ coefficients, but since we suppose that $N_1$ assumes a given value in $0, D_{ch}$, then it is possible to shift the estimate left of $N_1$ samples and obtain the estimate for $\hat{h}_i, i = -N_1, N_2$. 
The actual estimation is performed as in \cite[p.~246]{bc}, i.e. using a $L \times \hat{N}$ observation matrix

\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}} =
 \begin{bmatrix}
  a(\hat{N}-1) & \cdots & a(0) \\
  \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
a[(\hat{N}-1)+(L-1)] & \cdots & a(L-1) \\
 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
and a desired sample vector
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{o}^T = \left[ x(\hat{N}-1)\;,\; \ldots\; , \;x((\hat{N}-1)+(L-1)) \right].
\end{equation}
Therefore we can solve the LS problem as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathbf{h}}= \mathbf{\Phi}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\vartheta}, \quad\mathrm{ with } \quad \mathbf{\Phi}=\boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}}^H \boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}} \quad \mathrm{ and }\quad \boldsymbol{\vartheta} = \boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}}^H \mathbf{o}.
\end{equation}

In particular, in order to estimate as first the length $\hat{N} = N_1 + N_2 + 1$ of the impulse response and $N_1, N_2$, we operate as follows. Let $N_{max} = N_{seq} = 10$ the maximum possible length $\hat{N}$ of the impulse response. As first, we set $N_1 = 0$ and compute the functional of the error 
\begin{equation} 
	\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{k = \hat{N} - 1}^{(L-1)+(\hat{N}-1)}|d(k)-\hat{d}(k)|^2
	\label{eq:functional}
\end{equation}
for $N_2 = 0, 1, \dots, N_{max} - N_1 - 1$. This procedure is repeated for $N_1 = 1$ and $2$. The functionals $\mathcal{E}$ for different $N_1$ are then plotted together, against $N_2$, in Fig.~\ref{fig:functional}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{error_func_p1}
	\caption{$\mathcal{E}$ vs $N_2$ for different $N_1$}
	\label{fig:functional}
\end{figure}
It can be seen that there's a knee for $N_2 = 4 \forall N_1$, therefore we pick $N_2 = 4$. Then $N_1$ that minimizes $\mathcal{E}$ should be chosen, therefore $N_1 = 2$. However the 3 curves are very close to each other, and choosing $N_1 = 0$ would bring a similar functional $\mathcal{E}$ but a much lower complexity for Viterbi and FBA in the second problem. 

In Tables~\ref{table:h0} and~\ref{table:h2} are reported the amplitude and phase of $h_i, i = -N_1, \dots, N_2$, while in Fig.~\ref{fig:hi_p1} is reported the amplitude of both the choice $N_1 = 0$ and $N_1 = 2$. Note that they are very similar.

The noise that the channel introduces is $\sigma_w^2 = -19.2411$ dB, while the estimate $\hat{\sigma}_w^2 = something = -20.5327$ dB is lower (for the choice $N_1 = 0$, or $\hat{\sigma}_w^2 = -20.851$ for $N_1 = -2$). Note that this is the value given by a single estimate and not an expectation. However, this shows that a sequence of the given length $L = 15$ is too short to correctly estimate the real noise of the channel, since it averages on a number of noise samples which is close to the length of the impulse response we are trying to estimate. Indeed, by using a longer ML sequence (say 127) the estimate obtained is much closer to the real value also in each single realization.

At last, some considerations on the fact that the sequence used in this problem is a binary mapping in a QPSK constellation with $\sigma_a^2 = 2$ of a PN sequence. In particular let $a_l = (1+j) p_l$ with $p_l = \pm 1$ a symbol of the PN sequence. Then the autocorrelation of the sequence, of periodicity L, is
\begin{equation}
	r_a(n) = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{l = 0}^{L-1} a_l a^*_{l-n} = \\
	\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l = 0}^{L-1} (1+j)p_l (1-j)p^*_{l-n} = 
	\frac{2}{L} \sum_{l= 0}^{L-1} p_l p^*_{l-n} = 2 r_p(n)
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
	r_p(n) = 
  	\begin{cases}
    1       & \quad \text{if } n =0 \\
    -\frac{1}{L}  & \quad \text{if } n \neq 0 \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Therefore let $\Phi(i, n) = [\mathbf{\Phi}]_{i, n}$. Then
\begin{equation}
	\Phi(i, n) = (L -1 + N - N + 1)r_a(i-n) = 2Lr_p(i-n)
\end{equation}
At the same time $\vartheta(n) = 2Lr_{dp}(n)$ with $\boldsymbol{\vartheta} = [\vartheta(0), \dots, \vartheta(N-1)]$.
